We will be simulating that we work for a company that builds iOS and Android apps. The apps our company builds will be free to download and install with all of the revenue being generated by in-app advertisements. \n",

The 'Category' column seems to align better with the 'prime_genre' of the App Store data set so we will focus on this column for our analysis. We can see that the 'FAMILY' category is far and away the most common with 'GAME' the second most popular. We can make an assumption that the 'FAMILY' category contains apps that are family friendly, which may include things such as games or entertainment apps for children. In this way, the App Store and Google Play data sets are similar with apps geared toward entertainment being the most common. One difference is that practical apps like 'TOOLS', 'BUSINESS', 'LIFESTYLE', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'FINANCE' and 'MEDICAL' seem to be more common on the Google Play market which suggests a more even distribution of app types. However, as was the case with our frequency table for the 'prime_genre' column of the App Store data set, we still do not have enough information on the amount of users for each type of app which will be very important when making our recommendation so we must continue our analysis."

    "Our frequency tables were helpful in determining which apps are the most common on both of the marketplaces, but in order to make an informed recommendation we need to know which apps are the most popular, that is which apps have the most users. The Google Play data set has a column called 'Installs' that we can use to measure the average amount of users per genre, but the App Store data set is missing this column. For the App Store data set we will use the number of ratings an app has as a meausre of its popularity. This data can be found in the 'rating_count_tot' column. Below, we calculate the average amount of ratings for each app genre:"
