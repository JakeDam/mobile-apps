    "# Analysis of Mobile App Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will be analyzing data on iOS and Android mobile apps that are sold on Google Play and the App store. We will be simulating that we work for a company that builds iOS and Android apps. The apps our company builds will be free to download and install with all of the revenue being generated by in-app advertisements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal will be to analyze the data sets and gain insight into what type of app will be the most profitable. Since revenue is driven entirely by the amount of users that interact with the in-app advertisments, this means creating an app that will attract the highest amount of users possible. "
