We will be simulating that we work for a company that builds iOS and Android apps. The apps our company builds will be free to download and install with all of the revenue being generated by in-app advertisements. \n",

The 'Category' column seems to align better with the 'prime_genre' of the App Store data set so we will focus on this column for our analysis. We can see that the 'FAMILY' category is far and away the most common with 'GAME' the second most popular. We can make an assumption that the 'FAMILY' category contains apps that are family friendly, which may include things such as games or entertainment apps for children. In this way, the App Store and Google Play data sets are similar with apps geared toward entertainment being the most common. One difference is that practical apps like 'TOOLS', 'BUSINESS', 'LIFESTYLE', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'FINANCE' and 'MEDICAL' seem to be more common on the Google Play market which suggests a more even distribution of app types. However, as was the case with our frequency table for the 'prime_genre' column of the App Store data set, we still do not have enough information on the amount of users for each type of app which will be very important when making our recommendation so we must continue our analysis."

The Google Play data set has a column called 'Installs' that we can use to measure the average amount of users per genre, but the App Store data set is missing this column. For the App Store data set we will use the number of ratings an app has as a meausre of its popularity. This data can be found in the 'rating_count_tot' column. Below, we calculate the average amount of ratings for each app genre:"

    "This makes 'Navigation' apps possibly appear more popular than they are. We wouldn't necessarily want to recommend that our company develop a navigation app since that genre is dominated by Waze and Google Maps and then there is a steep drop off in reviews after that. This indicates that it could be hard for a new navigation app to gain traction in the App Store. A similar pattern can be seen in the 'Social Networking' genre, where Facebook and Pinterest dominate the genre. The 'Reference' genre is also dominated by Bible and Dictionary apps, however this genre may be easier to break into than 'Navigation' or 'Social Networking'. Using what we know from our analysis, it might be a reasonable idea to create a refernece app that has some type of game mechanism built in, with games being the most common type of app and reference being one of the most popular types."

This is in line with what we saw with the App Store and gives us reason to think that the books and reference category might be a good place for our app to break in. If we combine a book or reference app with some type of game mechanic, the app would likely be popular on both Google Play and the App Store."

    "In this project we analyzed data on mobile apps that are downloaded via the App Store and Google Play. Our goal was to determine which type of app would be profitable in both market places. Our validation strategy was to first release a basic version of the app on the Google Play market, and if after 6 months it is profitable, we will develop the app further and then also release it on the App Store. Our analysis showed us that entertainment apps such as games were very common in both marketplaces and also that reference/book apps were very popular for both but also had room for our app to break in. Using this knowledge, we would recommened to develop an reference/book app that has some kind of game mechanic, maybe an interactive book that tests the users knowledge of the book with games or quizzes as they read.
